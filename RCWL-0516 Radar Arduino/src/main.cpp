// I read your post and I wanted to try it for education purposes.
// At first I thought my RCWL-0516 sensor didn't work properly because
// I had to almost touch it to get a response. I read some comparable
// comments about the sensor. Was it damaged by static electricity or
// by soldering? I even ordered a new sensor and it gave the same results.
// However, I had always put it on a breadboard. Connecting it via 3 wires
// of 25 cm long and putting it further away from the breadboard made a
// world of difference. Could it be that the metal mesh in the breadboard
// (or the Arduino itself) will somehow 'jam the radar'? In my current setup
// it's really sensitive and it has a wide scope. So if it shows poor
// sensitivity, I suggest you try it ðŸ˜ƒ
