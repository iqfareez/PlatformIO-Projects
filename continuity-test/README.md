# DIY Simple continuity checker using Arduino

When the probe touches, it beeps. Simple as that.

## What you'll need

- Arduino UNO (I'm using [Maker UNO](https://my.cytron.io/p-maker-uno-simplifying-arduino-for-education?ref=99Y7TxrNIn6Jo)) - Of course, you can also use any other microcontrollers.
- [Piezo buzzer](https://my.cytron.io/p-buzzer-passive-with-jumper-housing?ref=99Y7TxrNIn6Jo) - Mine is already built in.
- [Jumper wire](https://my.cytron.io/p-male-to-male-jumper-wire?ref=99Y7TxrNIn6Jo) - Maybe you can combine it with other connecters eg banana, crocodile, multimeter test leads etc.

## Code

Go to `src/main.cpp`
